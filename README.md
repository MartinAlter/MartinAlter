Hi 👋, I’m @MartinAlter and I’m working as Head of Microsoft Consulting at Communardo Software GmbH. Since I was a teenager I’m interested in infrastructure, server deployment, application management and datacenter concepts overall operating systems. As a speaker at Office365 MeetUp Dresden, I love to share knowledge and have discussions about the new stuff in IT, specifically in Microsoft and Cloud technology. 

My carrier was started as a trainee at SLUB Dresden (Sächsische Landesbibliothek — Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek Dresden (SLUB)). After three years  I finished my schooling and start working to live at Communardo. The first years a was working as SysAdmin. I learned to allot of stuff about Windows SRV, Linux, SharePoint, Active Directory, Apache, Tomcat, and many other applications. After a while, I decided to switch to customer work as a Technical Consultant with a focus at Microsoft technologies. At the same time, I  had started a management training as System Manager. 3 years and a lot of stress later I finished the training as IT-Professional System Manager. Since October 2018 I’am a part of the management team at Communardo Software GmbH. My focus is to make the IT-Consulting better with global concepts and strategies in Azure, AWS, DevOps, and Automation over all platforms.
